GlassMorphism Login Page Project: Readme
This document provides an overview of the GlassMorphism Login Page project, its features, development environment, and instructions for running and contributing.

Project Overview
This project is a web page with a login form designed using the trend of GlassMorphism. This UI style creates a visually appealing and user-friendly experience with its semi-transparent and blurred elements that offer a peek into the background while maintaining focus on the foreground content.

Key Features:

GlassMorphism design: The login form and surrounding elements utilize the translucent and blurred effects of GlassMorphism.
Responsive layout: The page adapts to different screen sizes (desktop, mobile, etc.) for optimal viewing.
Accessibility considerations: Emphasis is placed on making the login form accessible to users with disabilities.
Clean and minimal design: The overall aesthetic focuses on user-friendliness and clarity.
Development Environment
Front-end technologies: HTML, CSS (e.g., SCSS, BEM methodologies), JavaScript (optional)
Optional frameworks/libraries: You can choose to use a front-end framework/library like Bootstrap or React, but the base implementation is framework-agnostic.
Testing tools: Unit tests and/or browser developer tools are recommended for quality assurance.
Running the Project
Clone the project repository: Use git clone [repository URL] to download the project files.
Install dependencies: If using any additional frameworks/libraries, install their dependencies by following their respective documentation.
Open the project files: Open the main HTML file (e.g., index.html) in a web browser to view the login page.
Optional development server: You can set up a local development server for live reloading and easier testing.
